<p> Not too long ago, we had a stellar qualifying match! I would like to congratulate our friends in Bear Metal for the first 40 kilo-pascal match of the competition! It was stunning to watch the fuel flying through the air, as our tension rises with the pressure. Cheering exploded as they breached the 40 kilo-pascal mark.

<p size="20px">4/7/17 8:33 am	<strong> DAY 2 - MASCOTS AND EXPLOSIONS </strong></p>
<p> While the people in the stands await for the events of the day to begin, a line of mascots twice the field's length long dances on the gamle floor. Close to 20 teams had full fur-suit mascots, while other teams, like ours, paraded in team colors, happy to be there! 
<br/> <br/>
Just after the mascots, the opening ceremony commenced, playing not one, but two welcome vidoes! They debuted a new video from Dean and Woody, which welcomed all the teams to the district championships.
<br/> <br/>
Next, the FIRST coordinator from Oregon gave us an explosive demonstration- he made a boiler explosion! He put about a liter of liquid nitrogen into a 2 liter soda bottle, and screwed on the cap. After dropping the bottle in a trash can, some assistants filled the can with fuel balls! after 10 seconds, the bottle exploded, sending fuel all the way up to the high ceiling!
<br/> <br/>
Finally, after more coordinators conversed with the stands about scholarships, college, and the likes, we were treated to a beautiful live performance of the National Anthem.

<p size="20px">4/6/17 2:52 pm	<strong> DAY 1 - LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP </strong></p>
<p> You always hear a collective groan resound across the masses when we hear the gut-wrenching bellow of a fog horn; no one wants to hear that there's a field error. As it turns out, there was issues with the rotors on an air ship. 
<br/> <br/>
However, it's not all bad when the field breaks, as the DJ is quick to find the perfect mood lifting song, which quickly gets everyone dancing the Cupid Shuffle, the Macarena, or another crowd favorite.

<p size="20px">4/6/17 1:50 pm	<strong> DAY 1 - THE STANDS </strong></p>
<p> Ever wonder what it's like to watch an FRC event? For one, there's always excitement in the air. Even if you sit next to someone you don't know, you're bound to make a new friend. 
<br/> <br/>
Secondly, the food is great. There's always a concession stand full of food for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and all the meals in between.
<br/><br/>
Finally, you'll be able to experience the spirit of FIRST for yourself. Everyone is so welcoming, you'll feel right at home no matter where you are.

<p> Our noon strategy sessions took place in and under a stairwell while we ate delicious sandwiches provided for us by EWU. Qualification matches will start at 2 o'clock, giving us another hour to eat and prepare to compete. In the meantime, food!

<p> With practice matches well under way, those of us in the stands have seen some impressive feats. During our first practice match, we loaded up one of our six autonomi modes. In a different match, we saw 2046's impressive shooter rack up points in the high goal.

<p> When you walk into breakfast at Tawanka hall, you might not expect amazing food. Before I walked in, I was imagining the breakfasts I got in middle school. However, I was pleasently surprised by a large buffet of food waiting for us. Anything you could want was there, from your average scrambled eggs to yogurt to biscuits & gravy! We all ate to our hearts content, ready for the long day ahead of us. </p>

<p> We're tired, but EWU had graciously hosted us, so it's time to head to our dorms! We picked up our keys earlier in the day and ate a few minutes ago. In need of a little of R&R, we hurriedly explore the maze of hallways.
<br/> <br/>
I am happy to report that the beds are comfy, the rooms are spacious, and the people are helpful. I love these dorms.

<p> As of right now, our team is being divvied up into volunteer groups. One group is already working at setting up tables in the pits. Another small group is constructing our pit. The third and final group, the one I'm in, is welcoming the incoming teams and helping them unload their pits. We're so happy and honored to be helping!

<p> It's 7:05, and we are on our way. It's a rainy, dreary morning, but we're anything but depressed. The drive out to Cheney is a long one, through mountains and across the eastern plateau. Despite the journey, we are all excited to arrive in Cheney this afternoon! </p>
