<p> A few minutes until lunch brought an exciting time- alliance selections. We were not a captain because we weren't ranked top eight, but we were picked during the first round of selection for the 6th seed team, 4089! We are also joined by team 1899 for the quarterfinal matches and beyond.

<p> Third match of the second day, and Team 4915 is doing amazing with shooting! They have a very consistant flywheel system that produces an amazing arc of fuel into the high boiler.
<br/> <br/>
Fourth match, and we get to see our swath of yellow! We're up with 1899 and 4681 on the Red Alliance. This year seems to be a great year with many amazing robots, plus there's yellow everywhere! Yellow Pit Admin Hats, yellow fuel, and yellow gears; Plus the volunteer shirts are Star Wars theme, just like our Jedi-Padiwan system! We finished the match with two bots in the air and our bot on the plate, which looked really pretty. Good match! </p>

<p size="20px">3/3/17 8:37pm	<strong> AUBURN MOUNTAINVIEW DAY 0 - PIT SET UP  </strong></p>
<p> Today is very exciting! We arrived at Auburn Mountainview with 15 minutes until the pits opened this afternoon, and as soon as the pits opened, we began furiously unpacking our trailer in the midst of hundreds of other robotics team members. We are very fortunate to have a corner pit, as our visibility is very high! 
<br/> <br/>
By 5:47, our pit was completely unpacked! Well, still a bit messy, but unpacked! We've since been ironing out details with Gemini, and have also been talking with other teams! Today we only brought a small team to unpack the pit; A few build team members, a programmer, and a singular media member for documentation. 
<br/> <br/>
7:30 marked the beginning of the Drive Team meeting, which went extremely well. We recieved clarification and reiteration on many Drive Team and Human Player rules, which is always welcome. 
<br/> <br/>
Right now, we are finalizing the pit and robot to be ready for the matches tomorrow! We've worked hard and played harder today, it's great to be here!</p>
