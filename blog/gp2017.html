<p size="20px">03/25/2017 8:29 am	<strong> GLACIER PEAK: STANDS - SET UP AND READY TO GO</strong></p>
<p> Our team unloaded the shop (at the pit) yesterday here at GlacierPeak. Our<br> 
robot is doing great and improved alot over these passed few weeks. I'm so excited<br>
for the competition to start up again.
<br/> <br/>
Our team set up in the near center of the stands, however I am set up at a corner, <br>
sitting with Apex only to plug in the laptop. I can see alot of people moving <br>
outand in of the stands (maybe to check up on their team's robot), I kind of understand,<br> 
sitting on rough seats for hours straight can be tough. I can hear lots of people<br> 
chatting in groups, followed by the sounds of the buzzer when it reaches<br>
specific points of time in the game, however, its just the volenteers testing them<br> 
out to see if the game is set up and working.
<br/><br/>
</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<p size="20px">3/25/2017 10:30 am	<strong> GLACIER PEAK: STANDS - 2 HOURS LATER...</strong></p>
<p>It's been quiet a while, right before our team got into queue for our first <br>
match, I checked up on the robot and the team, and they said they were doing alright.<br>
We just went through inspection, and the opening ceremony, and now we're going <br>
through the first couple of matches.
<br/> <br/>
My battery is full, so now I am able to go to and from the pit to find some more information<br>
about how our team is doing. Plus, I heard that there some documentary people are going<br>
to film us specificly, I can't wait how that expeirience will go. As I am typing right<br> 
now (since I am such a slow typer (11:09 am)) there are alot of mascots and people dancing<br> 
in front of the stands (due to the music playing).
<br/><br/>
Ps: Our team is about to compete for the first match
</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<p size="20px">3/25/2017 12:03 pm	<strong> GLACIER PEAK: STANDS/CAFETERIA - STARTED OUT WITH A GREAT START</strong></p>
<p>Oh yupp! Our team is doing great, and our alliance worked so well together, thank you 2605, <br>
and 1318. We won our first match (of the Glacier Peak event 2017). The drive team brought the robot <br>
down to the pit for the pit crew to work on the vision system (the vision system is<br> 
mostly a camera mounted onto the robot to help the drive team see where/how to collect gears),<br>
and a guide for the shooter. Meanwhile the documentary people ended up talking to the drive team<br> 
right after the match, followed by the judges talking to our pit crew about the robot. They also<br> 
send some of the drive team to other teams that they were paired up with in the next match. 
<br/> <br/>
Later,I went to the scouting crew (the people who stay in the stands and keep track of other teams <br>
robots (scouting is a big deal!) to see how they were doing. They said the new scouting system is <br>
doing great. Alex (development captain) made a code or a program that will improve the scouting system. 
<br/><br/>

<p size="20px">3/25/2017 1:58 pm	<strong> GLACIER PEAK: CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME</strong></p>
<p> The second match went well, and thanks again to the amazing alliance we had, thank you <br>
team 3663, and 5941. We were ranked first after that match. Meanwhile, in the pit, "The autonomous<br> 
for center peg and gear was successful" Antonio (Lead programer), "we are curently working on the <br>
IP Camera (vision) for the robot".
 
<br/> <br/>
So here I am, half battery, lunch time. Our team went to lunch at 12:30 or 1:00 (we had sandwiches),<br> 
but now its about over, Matches started up again. Our third match will start up at 2:35, curent time <br>
2:25. It usually take me about 30 minutes to write theseblogs, So sometimes I'll explain whats curently<br>
going on as I type.

<p size="20px">3/26/2017 8:13 am	<strong> GLACIER PEAK: STANDS - DAY 2: THE FINAL DAY FOR GLACIER PEAK</strong></p>
<p> Back for another day, today we're going to finish up the qualification matches (We have three <br>
matches left for qualifications), then we'll be going into alliance selections, final rounds, then into <br>
the Awards Ceremony. But first we got to go through the Opening Ceremony. 
<br/> <br/>
I am curently waching a parade of moscots from all teams marching through the field, it seems like the <br>
opening ceremony has started. As for yesterday, We did very well, we were paired up with great teams, <br>
followed by great opponents we faced.
<br/><br/>
<br>

<br/>
<p size="20px">3/26/2017 12:45 pm	<strong> GLACIER PEAK:STANDS - GREAT TEAMS, GREAT MATCHES, AND A GREAT LUNCH</strong></p>
<p> We had such a great time qualifying here at Glacier Peak, we saw a team who had <br>
an amazing shooter (team 4915), who had great blocking techniques (team 3268), who shot <br>
long distance (team 4682), and I even saw a team with great persistence (team 5941); they <br>
fell off of the rope two times and managed to climb all they way to the top to score for <br>
their alliance.
<br/> <br/>
Sadly, We did not make it to the finals, but thats not stopping our SOTAbot pride. <br>
After they anounced the finals, we headed to lunch to have some pizza. 
<br/><br/>
I can't wait for the final matches to start, the efferts of putting together <br>
the perfect team is going to be amazing.
