  <h2>The Awards Subteam</h2>
	<h2> What We Do </h2>
  <p> The SOTAbots uses FRC awards to shape our team's mission. When school starts up in the fall, students managers of our team revisit awards guildlines and start the processs of brainstorming and delegating each award to its appropriate subteam. We work in committees to organize for the Chairman's and Enginering Inspiration Award, and integrate the guildlines for the Gracious Professionalism, Spirit, Imagery, and Industrial Design Awards in the team's day-to-day operations.

  <h2>The Communications Subteam</h2>
  <p><h2> About Our Team </h2>
		<p> The SOTAbots are a local robotics team combining students from the Tacoma School of the Arts (SOTA), the Science and Math Institute (SAMi), and other local high schools including Stadium and Puyallup High School. We were founded in 2007 to break the stigma that artists cannot excel in science and math. We interpret the combination of STEM and the arts as STEAM: Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math. Our team is a part of the FIRST Robotics organization, a worldwide association designed to grow science and technology leaders. Every year, we design and build several robots to compete in a yearly challenge from FIRST. </p>
<hr color="#fff66"/>
<br/>
	<h2> Tacoma Robotics Alliance </h2>
		<p>Founded in 2011, the SOTAbots created the TRA as an organization that provides support and builds community for FIRST teams in the Puget Sound region. Every year, we construct a full-size practice field for every FRC and FTC game. Our practice field enables FRC and FTC team to test and practice with their FIRST robots so they can succeed in competition, and teams come from all over Washington to utilize this amazing resource. As we also have other free resources for teams that cannot make it to our location here.
<br/> <br/>
In the TRA we don’t just build robots, we build community.</p>
<hr color="#fff66"/>
<br/>
	<h2> Our Impact on the FIRSTWA Community </h2>
		<p>In 2015, our team members founded the Grant Robotic Arts Program at Grant Elementary, comprised of three FLL teams. We also started two FLL teams at Washington Elementary, as well as the three other FTC teams that we continue to mentor. We also support the FIRST community through volunteering at events. Throughout our team’s history, members have volunteered at over 50 FIRST events in every level of competition, and have logged an average of 2200 volunteer hours a year at events for the last three years. Additionally, we held our 3rd annual FRC workshop in 2015 for the FIRSTWA community. At this event, 72% of our presentations were led by SOTAbots, and they covered scouting, electronics, and everything in between. </p>
<hr color="#fff66"/>
<br/>
	<h2> Our Impact on the Broader Communityy </h2>
		<p>Outside of FIRST, the SOTAbots have visited local schools since 2009. In 2016, we visited over 30 classrooms and science fairs, impacting over 800 Pierce County students. In the summer, we partner with the Tacoma Public School District’s Xplore program to bring summer learning to over 400 low-income and underrepresented Tacoma elementary school students. At Xplore, we curb the summer academic slide by providing engaging summer learning through programming FLL robots. This is often the only opportunity many Tacoma children have to have student role-models to look up to.
<br/><br/>
We also attend many community events such the Tacoma Daffodil Parade, the Kent STEM Expo, and Artrageous; our school’s annual fundraiser. We have also formed partnerships with local museums in Tacoma such as the Lemay Car Museum and the Tacoma Children’s museum.
<br/><br/>
Our team has become a model for project-based learning in our state, and in 2016, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, Representative Laurie Jinkins, and executives from the Tacoma School Board visited our shop to see the impact of project-based learning on Washington students. We have also attended local town hall meetings and rallied at our state capital with other FIRST teams many times in support of FIRST and STEM education.
<br/><br/>
For the past 3 years we have partnered with the Abrepuertas community center in Coya, Peru, which provides education to a village with few opportunities. Just last February the kids finished their summer program and showed off their design and programming skills with the NXT robots we sent them at their first ever science fair!
<br/><br/>
But perhaps most importantly, our team supports the families at Mary Bridge Children’s Hospital in Tacoma. Our team started volunteering with Mary Bridge in 2013 and we have continued to strengthen our partnership with the hospital and at Treehouse, the onsite hotel. At Mary Bridge we volunteer in the playroom twice a month, bringing safe robots for the children in the hospital to play with.
<br/><br/>
In all that we do, we are constantly reminded that even a small act of kindness or support can have a huge positive impact on the lives of children in our community. </p>

  <h2>The Development Subteam</h2>
  <h2> Our 2016 Robot: A Synopsis on Pathfinder </h2>
		<p> 
In autonomous mode, Pathfinder is often positioned in front on the Cheval de Frise to smoothly cross the defense in autonomous. They can also cross any other static defense (and Portcullis) in autonomous if need be.
<br/> <br/>
In Tele-Op, our drive team is skilled at directing Pathfinder through cycles of shooting in the high goal, retrieving a ball in the neutral zone, and continuing to breach by going over an undamaged defense. We can reliably do four of these cycles per match. If our robot is solely shooting and being fed boulders, it can make seven high goal shots. Our catapult has an 85% accuracy, and shoots from the batter. Pathfinder can easily cross the Portcullis, Cheval de Frise, Ramparts, Moat, Rock Wall, Rough Terrain, and Low Bar. With assistance, the robot can damage the Drawbridge and Sally Port and likewise assist other robots to damage these two defenses.
<br/> <br/>
At the end of the match, Pathfinder has a reliable and awe-inspiring climbing arm that can scale the tower in under 10 seconds. We are very proud of our robot and we will be competing in St. Louis, MO at the FIRST World Championship Competition.

	<h2> Week 4 </h2>
		<p> This week took an unexpected turn when one of the bearings inside our mill broke, so we had to do without one for a few days, but now we have a better one! One of our mentors had a Bridgeport that they didn’t need anymore, so they gave it to us, which is we are sooooo thankful for!!!!! Despite this incident, the build team has moved from the prototype bot to the practice bot.
<br/> <br/>
The pillow blocks for the drivetrain have been welded on, as well as the uprights, catapult mount and arm mounts. Chain tensioners for the drivetrain are about halfway finished, but it’s undecided whether or not we will use them on the final bot, and the linear actuators should be done today or tomorrow. Soon we will completely finish our practice bot and we hope to have time at the end of build season to start using our final bot! </p>
<hr color="#ffff66"/>
<br/>
	<h2> Week 3 </h2>
		<p> Build Team has been rigorously working to finish our prototype robot, and has re-designed multiple mechanisms to better complete the game tasks. Because of complications regarding the size of the flywheel shooter, we are now using a catapult method. For the catapult, we were originally using surgical tubing as a tensioner, but are now testing springs which seem to be more efficient and reliable. The boulder intake system has also been drastically modified. A 32 inch long piece of box tubing, on both sides of the robot, connects to a platform near the ground. This platform is currently made of polycarbonate, but may change to a thin sheet aluminum for durability. A PVC pipe wrapped in polycord is adhered 9 ½ inches above the platform to grip balls and hold them against the bumpers so we can cross defenses with them. Our climbing method has not undergone any major adjustments, however the linear actuators’ we have been making for the intake arms have been shortened in length.
<br/> <br/>
To mount electronics, we have collectively decided to place triangular polycarbonate structures over the drivetrain to utilize available space. The plates are mounted at an 130° angle on either side of the wheels and so far, we’re able to place 7 talons on one side, and the bridge and power switch on the other. For the roboRIO, PDB/PDP, and voltage regulator, there is a plate underneath the catapult for easy access and protection. Lastly, we’ve been working closely with CAD team to finalize our electrical and mechanical drawings in Autodesk Inventor, and to help us catch flaws and conflicts before we cut material. Next week, we plan on having a welded frame with the drive train working, and the linear actuators complete. All in all, this week has been very productive, and we can’t wait to continue with build season!!!!
<br/> <br/>

<br/>
	<h2> Week 1 </h2>
		<p> Over the past week, the Build Team has been prototyping and testing multiple intake and shooting mechanisms for our 2016 bot. Our current strategy includes the ability to go under the low bar, shoot in the high goal, scale the wall, open the portcullis, and drive over defense categories B and D. To accomplish these tasks, our final design must be within 14 in. tall, 3 ½ ft. long, and 2 ft. wide. This requires that all mechanisms must be simple and low-profile.
<br/> <br/>
For shooting in the high goal, we plan on having a polycord belt intake in the back of the bot connected to a flywheel system in the front. However, if the modified prototype does not perform correctly, we have other design ideas including a catapult and kicker (both have been prototyped and work effectively). To acquire boulders, we’ll either drive up to them and start the belt intake, or have a retractable cube that folds down from the top of the bot, grabs the boulders, and then dumps them into the shooting mechanism.
<br/> <br/>
To get under the low bar, the top of our robot will either have an aluminum bar or polycarbonate sheet for the flap to slide over. We haven’t constructed a final design to hang on the pull-up bar but do have a few ideas. Most likely, the bot will have an extendable arm powered by a linear actuator, which will also have the ability to open the portcullis. Our second idea is to have a piece of thin, lightweight material meant to get a hook (connected to a winch with a rope-like cord) on the pull-up bar. Once the cord is hooked, the winch will be tightened to pull our robot up.
<br/> <br/>
Finally, to drive over defense categories B and D, we’ll have a 6 wheel pneumatic drive train. The total length on each side will be around 34 inches, and a total of 5 inches thick including the gearboxes. This design has been prototyped with high traction wheels, but not pneumatic wheels due to a backorder. Regardless, build season is off to a fantastic start!

	<h2> Beginning of Build Season 2016 </h2>
		<p> The first week of miniterm has been very productive for the build team! We have been working on reorganizing our shop and nesting after the move from Stewart Middle School this summer. The shop looks more like home now and everything is in its proper place. In addition to moving, students have been working on fixing all of the tools that were damaged during the move and building our Mary Bridge robots for Mary Bridge Children’s Hospital! The robots are coming along nicely and are built so the patients at Mary Bridge can play soccer with each other. Overall we have accomplished a lot this week and we cannot wait to find out the game tomorrow and start building our robot!!! </p>

  <h2>The Programming Subteam</h2>
  <h2> What is the Programming Team? </h2>
		<p> In order for the robot to run efficiently, we have to type a program that would work properly for our robot. Programming is a form of trial and error; we create a code, test the code, then adjust the code to fix errors and we do this until our code works properly. All the programming is done by our team with the help of our mentors.
 </p>
<hr color="#fff66"/>
</br>
	<h2> What We Do </h2>
		<p> We program robots in the Java programming language. Every programmer has a GitHub account so we can practice working in repositories and branches. It doesn’t matter what sort of level of experience you have coming into The SOTABots, when you leave, you’ll be in a position to give a workshop or lead the programming subteam with (relative) ease. Through collaboration among teammates as well as working with our programming mentors, each individual learns skills, such as how to work with others, meet deadlines, programming etiquette. </p>
